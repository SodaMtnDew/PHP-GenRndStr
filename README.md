# PHP-GenRndStr
Want to Generate Random String for Specific Purpose (Mostly as a Password) but Fearing Online Service WOULD Store the String for THEIR OWN PURPOSE? Just Build Your Own Generator!

Just put the given htm & php files into your php website, and remember to activate openssl extension in php.ini (a service restart would be necessary), access the htm using any browser! Now you get a web service that could help generating random string in assigned length & options.

If using it in the Intranet of your office, you could modify the code as you wish to store any generated string in db. (Tested on Windows 11 with Apache 2.4.63 & php 8.4.7, AND ubuntu 24.04.2 server with default packages apache2 & php.)
